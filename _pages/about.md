I am an Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on enhancing the efficiency of generative and transformer models. Currently, I am part of [Huawei Technologies Canada](https://www.huawei.com/ca/), where I explore innovative solutions to optimize Large Language Models (LLM) performance. My recent work involves implementing speculative techniques and transforming models to improve computational efficiency.

I completed my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science supervised by [Dr. Ali Ghodsi](https://aghodsib.github.io/) and [Dr. Mohammad Kohandel](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/profiles/mohammad-kohandel) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), where I researched integrating protein language models for antibody design. During my studies, I contributed to data science and machine learning projects at [General Motors Canada](https://www.gm.ca/en/home.html) as a co-op. Prior to my master's, I worked at [Digikala](https://www.digikala.com/) as a Machine Learning Engineer. I earned my BSc in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.

I am passionate about advancing AI technologies and am particularly interested in leveraging state-of-the-art models to uncover hidden patterns in data. I enjoy creating solutions that bring automation and efficiency to various applications.

I love connecting with new people to explore collaboration opportunities, exchange ideas, or simply share experiences. Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:benyamin.jami76@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-jami/).
